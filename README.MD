Before contributing please read the following:

4. [Vue.js styleguide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/index.html). Priority A and B categories must be respected.
5. [Editorconfig setup](https://editorconfig.org/#download). Most of the common editors support editorconfig by default (check the editorconfig download link for your ide), but editorconfig npm package have to installed globally for it to work,

```bash
# install editorconfig globally
> npm install -g editorconfig
```

The stack is built using [vue-cli webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) so to get started all you have to do is:

```bash
# install dependencies
> yarn install
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
> yarn serve
```

Other commands available are:

```bash
# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# run unit tests
yarn test
```

## To know

Current arbitrary choices are:

- Vuex modules for store
- Vue-axios for ajax requests
- 'rwv' as prefix for components

These can be changed when the contributors reach a consensus.
